The view that was given to our team required internal implementation such as Note, AbsolutePitch
and the util classes. Some part part of the view used field of field access in the note. I asked
our provider to encapsulate all the fields access to getter methods. By having getter methods,
it allowed us to adapt our code. Not only that, if the library author wanted to change the field
to a different name. Then the author only need to change the field in the getter method instead
of hunting down to every usage of that field.
